# Developer Overview

Welcome to the Doofus developer documentation. This guide will help you understand how to work with Doofus AI agents effectively.

## Core Concepts

- **AI Agents**: Understanding the Doofus agent architecture
- **Training Data**: How to prepare and manage training data
- **Integration Points**: Available integration methods and APIs
- **Customization**: Ways to extend and customize agent behavior

## Development Stack

Doofus is built with modern technologies:

- Next.js for the frontend and API routes
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Biome for code quality

## API Quick Start

Here's a quick example of chatting with a Doofus AI agent:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Request
curl -X POST https://api.doofus.com/v1/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chatbotId": "ckl123abc456",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What can you help me with?"
      }
    ],
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
  }'
```

```json Response (200)
{
  "text": "I can assist you with various tasks like answering questions, helping with code, analyzing data, and providing recommendations. Feel free to ask me anything!"
}
```
