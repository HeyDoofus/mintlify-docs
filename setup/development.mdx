## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

## Code Style and Formatting

We use Biome for both linting and formatting. Biome is configured through the `biome.json` file in the project root.

## TypeScript Configuration

The project uses TypeScript for type safety. The configuration can be found in `tsconfig.json`. We use strict type checking to ensure code quality.

## Working with the App Router

This project uses Next.js 16's App Router. Here's how the routing works:

- `src/app/page.tsx` - The main page component
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - The root layout component
- `src/app/globals.css` - Global styles

## Styling with TailwindCSS

The project uses TailwindCSS for styling. You can find utility classes for:

- Dark mode (`dark:` prefix)
- Responsive design (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes)
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Typography and spacing

## Development Best Practices

1. Always run TypeScript type checking before committing
2. Use Biome's formatting before commits
3. Follow the existing code structure
4. Utilize Next.js's built-in features when possible
